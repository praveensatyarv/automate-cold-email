    In December 2019, I bought my first laptop—an Asus ZenBook powered by an AMD Ryzen processor. I still remember feeling proud after weeks of obsessing over benchmarks and reviews. Ever since, I have been following the innovations at AMD, and it’s been a dream of mine to contribute to AMD’s legacy. 
</p>
<p>
    I’ve followed AMD’s recent supply chain challenges, particularly the export restrictions to China and the resulting $800M write-down from unsold MI300 chips. I understand how critical it is to reroute shipments efficiently, rebalance global inventory, and reduce delivery risk across regions.
</p>
<p>
    That’s precisely the problem I’ve tackled in my recent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/part-2-logistics-supply-chain-analytics-utilizing-tableau-r-v--l9ugc/">supply chain analytics project</a>, where I helped a major e-commerce company in Brazil improve its logistics operations using cloud-based analytics. A brief overview of the project:
    <ul>
        <li>Reduced manual data prep by 90% by building an end-to-end AWS pipeline (Glue, S3, IAM, PySpark) to process 100K+ shipment records, streamlining ETL for logistics reporting.</li>
        <li>Improved shipment visibility across Brazil by developing a real-time  <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/praveen.satya.r.v/viz/ecommerce-logistics-dashboard/SupplyChainandLogisticsDashboard?publish=yes">Tableau dashboard</a> connected via Amazon S3, analyzing 3 years of freight, delivery, and cycle time data.</li>
        <li>Identified root causes of delays in last-mile delivery and seller performance—revealing that 59% of late shipments exceeded 6 days, leading to targeted improvements in geographic routing and vendor SLAs.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    I can bring that same level of insight and impact to AMD’s global operations—by helping optimize rerouting strategies, automate logistics pipelines, uncover customs bottlenecks, and forecast post-restriction demand using advanced analytics.
</p>
<p>
    If you’re facing any business challenges at AMD that you want to solve using data analytics, I’d love to share ideas and brainstorm solutions. Please let me know if there’s any way I can add value to your team.
